# Faseeh - Language Learning App

Faseeh is a minimal language learning application built with Flutter. It simulates the experience of learning from media content by displaying videos with static captions, preparing the foundation for AI-enhanced features.

## Features (MVP)

- **Simulated Video Player:** Shows a local video with simple playback controls (Play/Pause, Mute, Seek)
- **Static Captions:** Displays a hardcoded caption below the video to simulate subtitle or AI-transcribed content
- **Clean Interface:** Simple UI layout designed for later expansion (e.g., AI integration, media import)


## Screenshots

  <tr>
